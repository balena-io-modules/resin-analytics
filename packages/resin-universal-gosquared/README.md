# Resin Universal gosquared Wrapper

Loads the `gosquared` module in Node.js and (asynchronously) the client library from the CDN in the browser.

Browser usage needs Webpack, Browserify or other bundler that tolerates the `browser` field in `package.json`.

## Installing

```sh
$ npm install resin-universal-gosquared
```
